# Titanic Survival Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a machine learning classification model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using demographic and ticket information.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Public Titanic dataset
- Records: 891 passengers
- Features: Age, Sex, Class, Fare, Survival

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## 🔍 Steps Performed
1. Data cleaning
2. Handling missing values
3. Encoding categorical variables
4. Train-test split
5. Logistic Regression model
6. Accuracy evaluation

## 📈 Results
- Model Accuracy: ~78–82%
- Females had higher survival probability
- Higher class passengers survived more
